## LARL - Open Source Laravel 5 URL Shortener

LARL is a free and open source URL shortener based on Laravel 5. 

## Official Documentation

[You can check it here on a subdomain of mine](http://larl.neveshtar.com/public)

(Seems Laravel 5 is now using 5.5.9 as the minimum requirement. This is why my server is returning a blank page. Guess you have to run it locally until I upgrade PHP on my server. Don't want to rush into the upgrade and break up the websites I'm hosting.)

The installation is fairly easy. 
* Clone it. 
* Use the command "composer update" in the root folder. 
* Create a fresh mysql database.
* Import the sql file located in the "sql" folder.
* Insert it's variables in the ".env" file located in the root.
* Give write permission to the "storage" folder.
* You should be all set to go!
